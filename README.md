# Centurion: A Roman soldier with authority over 100 Legionaries.

Nathan Krupa writes grants professionally to raise money to feed the hungry. He also blogs about fundraising as [The Almoner](https://thealmoner.com) and has published the book [Letters from the Almoner](https://amzn.to/2NOZt46) on the topic of fundraising in the church and ministry. He recently created the [Fundraiser Wiki](https://fundraiserwiki.thealmoner.com) to build a collaborative knowledgebase focused on fundraising best practices. 

Confirming his passion to be an indie author, Nathan just published his second book, [Demoniac](https://amzn.to/39qHx96), which tells the story being possessed by the devil and what it took to get free. He is building a companion site to the book at [Demoniac.net](https://demoniac.net).

Nathan is just starting his adventure in learning to code, however, and looks forward to improving his websites and learning how to use advanced data analytics for fundraising. He's also hoping to be learn to program biomimetic robots. In pursuit of this long term goal, he recently purchased an Ender 3 printer. Since opening the box and putting it together, he has learned two things. 1. 3D printing is a lot harder than printing words and pictures on paper. 2. It's also a lot cooler. He's hooked and will be learning more about 3D printing in the years to come.

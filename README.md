Nathan Krupa writes grants professionally to raise money to feed the hungry. He also blogs about fundraising as [The Almoner](https://thealmoner.com) and has published the book [Letters from the Almoner](https://amzn.to/2NOZt46) on the topic of fundraising in the church and ministry. He recently created the [Fundraiser Wiki](https://fundraiserwiki.com) to build a collaborative knowledgebase focused on fundraising best practices. 

Confirming his passion to be an indie author, Nathan just published his second book, [Demoniac](https://amzn.to/39qHx96), which tells the story being possessed by the devil and what it took to get free. 

Nathan's main personal blog is [NathanKrupa.com](https://nathankrupa.com), where he shares the stories of his family's adventures and his growth in the Christian spiritual life.

Nathan is just starting his adventure in learning to code with python, and looks forward to improving his websites and learning how to use advanced data analytics for fundraising. 

He's also hoping to be learn to program biomimetic robots. In pursuit of this long term goal, he purchased an Ender 3 printer. Since opening the box and putting it together, he has learned two things. 1. 3D printing is a lot harder than printing words and pictures on paper. 2. It's also a lot cooler. He's hooked and will be learning more about 3D printing in the years to come. 

Since buying the printer, he's started teaching an elective on 3D printing and electronics at the private school his children attend. His students are currently learning to use Makecode to create their own video games, and they just got a bunch of Adafruit [pybadges](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200) to try their games out in the real world.
